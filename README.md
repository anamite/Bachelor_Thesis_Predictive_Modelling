# Sales Forecasting Project

This repository contains a set of Jupyter Notebooks used for sales forecasting, data preprocessing, and model development. The project aims to predict future sales based on historical data using various machine learning models and techniques.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Forecasting_PreprocessedData_BT.ipynb**
   - This notebook contains the preprocessing steps applied to the sales data. It prepares the data for further analysis and modeling by handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

2. **RandomForests.ipynb**
   - This notebook implements the Random Forest algorithm to predict future sales. It includes model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

3. **SalesForecasting_BT_EDA.ipynb**
   - This notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the sales data. It visualizes key trends, distributions, and correlations to better understand the data and inform modeling decisions.

4. **Sales_Forecasting_BT_DataProcessing.ipynb**
   - This notebook handles additional data processing tasks. It may include tasks like feature extraction, transformation, and cleaning that are necessary before applying machine learning algorithms.
